    "**Acknowledgements:** The following assignment is based on GeeksforGeeks [tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/opencv-python-tutorial/). \n",
    "This assignment is a quick introduction to the vast capabilities of the opencv library. It is highly recommended you also peruse through these tutorials in addition to this.\n",

    "## What is OpenCV?\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV is a popular open-source library for both computer vision, machine learning, and image processing used by both industry and academia to solve image processing problems. It can be used in C++, Java and Python (the language of our focus). It can do anything from manipulating images for pre-processing to running machine learning models such as SVM's to identify hand-written letters. Furthermore, this library is highly optimized for numerical operations and uses numpy arrays to represent images."
